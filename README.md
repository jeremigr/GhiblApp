GhiblApp is a simple responsive React app using the Studio Ghbli API to display the list of their long-feature movies.

GhiblApp uses the Studio Ghibli API to display their long feature movies. When a title is clicked, it displays the movie's image and description.
You can also sort the list by year, title or director, or look for a specific movie or director in the search bar.
