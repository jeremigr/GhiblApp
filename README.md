GhiblApp is a simple React app, that uses the Studio Ghbli API to display the list of all long-feature movies released by Studio Ghibli, sorted chronologically. 

It includes a search field to look for a movie title or a director's name. 

If you click on a title, the default image is replaced by one from the movie, followed by its description. 

A "sort by" feature also allows you to sort the list by movie title, director or year.
