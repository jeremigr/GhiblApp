GhiblApp is a simple responsive React app, that uses the Studio Ghibli API to list their feature films chronologically. 

When a title is clicked, it shows the movie’s image and description, and it also allows searching by title or director.

I'm planning to add a Sort by option soon (alphabetical order, by director, etc.).
