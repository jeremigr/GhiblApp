GhiblApp is a simple React responsive web app, using the Studio Ghbli API to display the list of their long-feature movies.

When a title is clicked, it displays the movie's image and description.

You can also sort the list by title, director, or year (ascendant or descendant), or look for a specific movie or director in the search bar. 
Clicking on the explorer's main image displays a random movie from the list. 

Note: While my programming culture is solid, I'm still learning it in practice.
